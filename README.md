# Linker
Go to terminal and type:
> make


This will create linker.exe, then you can test inputs:


> ./linker <name-of-the-input-file>

The folder lab1samples also has scripts to check all the sample inputs. To test them:


Create yourself a directory <your-outdir> where your outputs will be created.
  
> cd labsamples


> ./runit.sh <your-outdir> <path-to-linker.exe>
  
  
> ./gradeit.sh . <your-outdir>
